capstone project

Dataset Description
The dataset contains 16 columns and 799 rows, with the following features:

1. date: Date of observation
2. daily_cases: Number of new COVID-19 cases reported on that date
3. lockdown_measures: Lockdown measures implemented on that date (0-3)
4. school_closing: School closing measures implemented on that date (0-3)
5. workplace_closing: Workplace closing measures implemented on that date (0-3)
6. gatherings_restrictions: Gatherings restrictions implemented on that date (0-4)
7. transport_closing: Transport closing measures implemented on that date (0-2)
8. stay_home_restrictions: Stay home restrictions implemented on that date (0-3)
9. contact_tracing: Contact tracing measures implemented on that date (0-2)
10. facial_coverings: Facial coverings measures implemented on that date (0-4)
11. vaccination_policy: Vaccination policy implemented on that date (0-5)

Data Preprocessing
The dataset requires preprocessing to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing the distribution of features and identifying correlations between them.

Distribution of Features
The distribution of features can be visualized using histograms or box plots.

Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis involves calculating the correlation coefficient between features.

Regression Analysis
Regression analysis involves modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (daily_cases) and independent variables (lockdown_measures).

Linear Regression
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables.

Non-Linear Regression
Non-linear regression assumes a non-linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables.

Model Evaluation
Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the regression model.

Metrics
Metrics used to evaluate the model include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

Results
The results of the analysis can be used to identify the most effective lockdown measures in reducing COVID-19 cases.

Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of lockdown measures in reducing COVID-19 cases.

Recommendations
Recommendations can be made based on the findings of the analysis.

Limitations
Limitations of the analysis include the quality of the data and the assumptions made in the regression model.

Future Work
Future work can involve collecting more data and using more advanced machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.
